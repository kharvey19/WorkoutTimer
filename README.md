# Welcome to my Workout Timer App!!

The Interval Timer App helps you stay on track during your runs or walks by reminding you when to switch between running and walking. You can input your intervals, and the app will vibrate when it’s time to change actions.

## How It Works

1. Input Your Intervals:

- On the first screen, enter the time in seconds for each interval (e.g., 300 seconds for running, 60 seconds for walking).
- Add as many intervals as you need.

2. Start Your Workout:
- After entering your intervals, press "Start Workout."
- The second screen will show a timer that counts down each interval.
- The app will vibrate when it’s time to switch.


## Features
- Simple interface to input and manage intervals.
- Vibration notifications to remind you when to switch.
- Automatic looping of your interval sets.
